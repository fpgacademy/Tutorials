% Pin Assignments

% Additional to pin assignments sections.
For convenience when using large designs, all relevant pin assignments for the 
DE-series board are given in individual files. For example, the DE1-SoC pin assignments 
can be found in the {\it DE1\_SoC.qsf} file, which is available from Intel's FPGA University
Program website.
This file uses the names found in the {\it DE1-SoC User Manual}.
If we wanted to make the pin assignments for our example circuit by importing
this file, then we would have to use the same names in our 
Block Diagram/Schematic design file;
namely, {\it SW[0]}, {\it SW[1]} and {\it LEDG[0]} for 
{\it x1}, {\it x2} and {\it f}, respectively.
Since these signals are specified in the {\it DE1\_SoC.qsf} file
as elements of vectors {\it SW} and {\it LEDG}, we must refer to them in the same
way in our design file. For example, in the {\it DE1\_SoC.qsf} 
file the 10 toggle switches are called {\it SW[9]} to {\it SW[0]}.
In a design file they can also be referred to as a vector {\it SW[9..0]}.
