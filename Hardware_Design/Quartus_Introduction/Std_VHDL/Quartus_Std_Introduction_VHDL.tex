% Additional to pin assignments sections.
For convenience, all important settings for a specific DE-series board, such as device and
pin assignments, are available in a file that can be downloaded from the 
\texttt{Teaching and Projects Boards} section of the website
{\small \href{https://www.fpgacademy.org/boards.html} {FPGAcademy.org}}. 
Any of these assignment files can be downloaded to your computer by clicking on the 
corresponding {\sf QSF} item that is provided along with the description of the board. 

As an example, the {\sf QSF} file that you can download for the DE1-SoC board is 
named {\it DE1\_SoC.qsf}. This file provides various types of assignments, including
pin assignments for {\it all} signals on the board. You can import these assignments into
your Quartus Prime project, as described above. The pin assignments in the file 
{\it DE1\_SoC.qsf} use the signal names that are defined in the user manual for the board,
in this case the {\it DE1-SoC User Manual}.  
If we wanted to make the pin assignments for our example circuit 
by importing this file, then we would have to use the same names in our \typeName~code that
are used in this {\it DE1\_SoC.qsf} file. In our example, this means that instead of the
top-level ports named {\it x1}, {\it x2} and {\it f}, we would name these ports 
{\it SW[0]}, {\it SW[1]} and {\it LEDG[0]}, respectively, because those are the names
used in the {\it DE1\_SoC.qsf} file.
