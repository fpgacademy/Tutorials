\section{Testing the Designed Circuit}

Before implementing the designed circuit in the FPGA chip on the DE-series board, it is
prudent to simulate it to ascertain its correctness. While not covered in this tutorial,
users may use software such as {\it ModelSim} or other simulation environments to test the 
circuit in simulation. Simulation of a circuit often provides a comprehensive view of the 
circuit's functionality, and can help users easily find bugs within the circuit's logic 
without having to touch hardware.

Having downloaded the configuration data into the FPGA device, you can now
test the implemented circuit.  Try all four valuations of the input variables
$x_1$ and $x_2$, by setting the corresponding states of the switches
$SW_1$ and $SW_0$. Verify that the circuit implements the truth table
in Figure~\ref{fig:11}.

If you want to make changes in the designed circuit, first close the Programmer window.
Then make the desired changes in the \typeName{} design file, compile the circuit,
and program the board as explained above.
