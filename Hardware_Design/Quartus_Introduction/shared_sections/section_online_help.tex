\subsection{Quartus\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Prime Online Help}


The Quartus Prime software provides comprehensive online documentation that addresses
many of the questions that may arise when using the software. The documentation is accessed
from the {\sf Help} menu.  To get some idea of the extent of documentation provided,
it is worthwhile for the reader to browse through the {\sf Help} menu.

The user can quickly search through the {\sf Help} topics by using the 
search box in the top right corner of the main Quartus display.
Another method, context-sensitive help, is provided for quickly finding documentation for
specific topics. While using most applications, pressing the {\sf F1} function
key on the keyboard opens a Help display that
shows the commands available for the application.
