\section{Design Entry Using the Graphic Editor}

\noindent
As a design example, we will use the two-way light controller circuit shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:11}. The circuit can be used to control a single light from either of the
two switches, $x_1$ and $x_2$, where a closed switch corresponds to the logic value 1.
The truth table for the circuit is also given in the figure. Note that
this is just the Exclusive-OR function of the inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$,
but we will implement it using the gates shown.
 
\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/figure11.png}
   \caption{The light controller circuit.} 
	 \label{fig:11}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

The Quartus Prime Graphic Editor can be used to specify a circuit in the form of a
block diagram.
Select {\sf File $>$ New} to get the window in Figure~\ref{fig:12}, 
choose {\sf Block Diagram/Schematic File}, and click {\sf OK}. 
This opens the Graphic Editor window. 
The first step is to specify a name
for the file that will be created. Select {\sf File $>$ Save As}
to open the pop-up box depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:13}. 
In the box labeled {\sf Save as type} choose {\sf Block Diagram/Schematic File (*.bdf)}.
In the box labeled {\sf File name} type {\it light}, to match the name given
in Figure~\ref{fig:4}, which was specified when the project was created.
Put a checkmark in the box {\sf Add file to current project}.
Click {\sf Save}, which puts the file into the directory
{\it introtutorial} and leads to the Graphic Editor window displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:14}.
 
\begin{figure}[H]

      \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/figure12.png}
   \caption{Choose to prepare a block diagram.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

      \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/figure14.png}
   \caption{Graphic Editor window.} 
	 \label{fig:14}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Importing Logic-Gate Symbols}
The Graphic Editor provides a number of libraries which include circuit elements
that can be imported into a schematic. 
Double-click on the blank space in the Graphic Editor window,
or click on the \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/icon1.png} icon in the toolbar
that looks like an AND gate.
A pop-up box in Figure~\ref{fig:15} will appear. Expand the hierarchy 
in the Libraries box as shown in the figure. First expand {\it libraries}, then
expand the library {\it primitives}, followed by expanding the library {\it logic} 
which comprises the logic gates.
Select {\it and2}, which is a two-input AND gate, and click {\sf OK}.
Now, the AND gate symbol will appear in the Graphic Editor window.
Using the mouse, move the symbol to a desirable location and click to place it there.
Import a second AND gate by repeating the previous steps. Note that you
can enable the {\sf Repeat-insert mode} in the {\sf Symbol} window
to quickly add multiple copies of a gate.
A symbol in the Graphic Editor window can be moved by clicking the
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/icon4.png} icon in the toolbar
that looks like a mouse cursor, then clicking the symbol you want to move
and dragging it to a new location with the mouse button pressed.
Next, select {\it or2} from the library and import the OR gate into the diagram.
Then, select {\it not} and import two instances of the NOT gate. 
Rotate the NOT gates into proper position by right clicking on the desired gate
and selecting {\sf Rotate by Degrees $>$ Rotate Left 90}, or by using the 
``Rotate left 90" icon \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/icon2.png}.
Arrange the gates as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:16}.
 
\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/figure15.png}
   \caption{Choose a symbol from the library.} 
	 \label{fig:15}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{figures/figure16.png}
   \caption{Import the gate symbols into the Graphic Editor window.} 
	 \label{fig:16}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Importing Input and Output Symbols}

Having entered the logic-gate symbols, it is now necessary to enter the
symbols that represent the input and output ports of the circuit.
Use the same procedure as for importing the gates, but choose the port 
symbols from the library {\it primitives/pin}.
Import two instances of the input port and one instance of the output port,
to obtain the image in Figure~\ref{fig:17}.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/figure17.png}
   \caption{Import the input and output pins.} 
	 \label{fig:17}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Assign names to the input and output symbols as follows.
Make sure nothing is selected by clicking on an empty spot in the Graphic Editor window.
Point to the top input symbol and double-click
the mouse. The dialog box in Figure~\ref{fig:18} will appear. Type the pin name, $x1$,
and click {\sf OK}. Similarly, assign the name $x2$ to the other input and $f$
to the output. Alternatively, it is possible to change the name of an element by
double-clicking on the name and typing a new one directly.
 
\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.60]{figures/figure18.png}
   \caption{Naming of a pin.} 
	 \label{fig:18}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Connecting Nodes with Wires}

The symbols in the diagram have to be connected by drawing lines (wires).
Click on the icon \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/icon3.png} in the toolbar
to activate the Orthogonal Node Tool.
Position the mouse pointer over the right edge of the $x1$ input pin.
Click and hold the mouse button and drag the mouse to the right until the drawn
line reaches the pinstub on the top input of the AND gate. Release the mouse button when you see a box appear,
which leaves the line connecting the two pinstubs. Next, draw a wire from the input
pinstub of the leftmost NOT gate to touch the wire that was drawn above it. 
Note that a dot will appear indicating a connection between the two wires.

Use the same procedure to draw the remaining wires in the circuit. If a mistake is made,
a wire can be selected by clicking on it, and
removed by pressing the Delete key on the keyboard. Upon completing
the diagram, click on the \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/icon4.png} icon, to activate the Selection
Tool. Now, changes in the appearance of the diagram can be made by
selecting a particular symbol or wire and either moving it to a different location or
deleting it. The final diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:19}; save it.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/figure19.png}
   \caption{The completed schematic diagram.} 
	 \label{fig:19}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Compiling the Designed Circuit}

The entered schematic diagram file, {\it light.bdf}, is processed by several 
Quartus Prime tools that analyze the file, synthesize the circuit,
and generate an implementation of it for the target chip. 
These tools are controlled by the application program called the {\it Compiler}.

Run the Compiler by selecting {\sf Processing $>$ Start Compilation}, or by 
clicking on the toolbar icon \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/icon5.png} that looks like a
blue triangle. Your project must be saved before compiling. 
As the compilation moves through various stages, its progress is reported
in a window on the left side of the Quartus Prime display.
In the message window, at the bottom of the figure, various messages are displayed
throughout the compilation process.
In case of errors, there will be appropriate messages given.

When the compilation is finished, a compilation report is produced.
A tab showing this report is opened automatically, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:20}.
The tab can be closed in the normal way, and it can be opened at any time
either by selecting {\sf Processing $>$ Compilation Report} or by clicking on 
the icon \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/icon6.png}.
The report includes a number of sections listed on the left side.
Figure~\ref{fig:20} displays the Compiler Flow Summary section, which
indicates that only one logic element and three pins are needed to implement this 
tiny circuit on the selected FPGA chip.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/figure20.png}
   \caption{Display after a successful compilation.} 
	 \label{fig:20}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Errors}

Quartus Prime software displays messages produced during compilation in the Messages window.
If the block diagram design file is correct, one of the messages will
state that the compilation was successful and that there are no
errors.

If the Compiler does not report zero errors, then there is at least one mistake 
in the schematic entry. In this case a
message corresponding to each error found will
be displayed in the Messages window.
Double-clicking on an error message will highlight the offending
part of the circuit in the Graphic Editor window. 
Similarly, the Compiler may display some warning messages. Their details can be
explored in the same way as in the case of error messages.
The user can obtain more information about a specific error or warning message
by selecting the message and pressing the {\sf F1} function key.

To see the effect of an error, open the file {\it light.bdf}.
Remove the wire connecting the output of the top AND gate to the OR gate.
To do this, click on the \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/icon4.png} icon,
click the mouse on the wire to be removed (to select it) and press Delete. 
Compile the erroneous design by clicking on the \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/icon5.png} icon.
A pop-up box will ask if the changes made to the {\it light.bdf} file should be saved;
click {\sf Yes}. After trying to compile the circuit,
Quartus Prime software will display error messages in the Messages window, and 
show that the compilation failed in the {\sf Analysis \& Synthesis} stage of the compilation process.
The compilation report summary, given in Figure~\ref{fig:21}, 
confirms the failed result. In the Table of Contents panel, expand the {\sf Analysis \& Synthesis} part of the report
and then select {\sf Messages} to have the messages displayed as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:22}.
The Compilation Report can be displayed as a separate window as in Figure~\ref{fig:22} 
by right-clicking its tab and selecting {\sf Detach Window}, and can be reattached by clicking
{\sf Window > Attach Window}.
Double-click on the first error message, which states that one of the nodes
is missing a source.
Quartus Prime software responds by displaying the {\it light.bdf}
schematic and highlighting the OR gate which is affected by the error,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:23}.
Correct the error and recompile the design.

\section{Pin Assignment}

During the compilation above, the Quartus Prime Compiler was free to choose any
pins on the selected FPGA to serve as inputs and outputs. However, the DE-series board
has hardwired connections between the FPGA pins and the other components on the board.
We will use two toggle switches, labeled $SW_0$ and $SW_1$, to provide the
external inputs, $x_1$ and $x_2$, to our example circuit. These switches are connected
to the FPGA pins listed in Table \ref{tab:pinassign}. We will connect the output $f$ to a
light-emitting diode on your DE-series board. For the DE2-115 we will use a green LED: $LEDG_0$.
On the DE0-CV, DE1-SoC, DE10-Lite and DE10-Standard, we will use $LEDR_0$. On the DE0-Nano and DE0-Nano-SoC, we will use $LED_0$
The FPGA pin assignment for the LEDs can also be found in Table~\ref{tab:pinassign}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
\hline
Component & $SW_0$ & $SW_1$ & {\it LEDG}$_0$, {\it LED}$_0$, or {\it LEDR}$_0$ \\

\caption{DE-Series Pin Assignments}
\label{tab:pinassign}
\end{table}\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figures/figure24.png}
   \caption{The Assignment Editor window.} 
	 \label{fig:24}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Pin assignments are made by using the Assignment Editor. 
Select {\sf Assignments $>$ Assignment Editor} to reach the window in Figure~\ref{fig:24}
(shown here as a detached window).
In the {\sf Category} drop-down menu select {\sf All}. Click on the {\sf $<$$<$new$>$$>$} button
located near the top left corner to make a new item appear in the table. Double click the box
under the column labeled To so that the Node Finder button \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figures/icon7.png}
appears. Click on the button (not the drop down arrow) to reach the window in Figure~\ref{fig:25}. Click on \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/icon12.png} and \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/icon15.png} to show or hide more search options.
In the {\sf Filter} drop-down menu select {\sf Pins: all}. Then click the {\sf List} button to display
the input and output pins to be assigned: $f$, $x1$, and $x2$.
Click on $x1$ as the first pin to be assigned and click the {\sf >} button; this will enter
$x1$ in the Selected Nodes box.  Click {\sf OK}. $x1$ will now appear in the box under the column
labeled To. Alternatively, the node name can be entered directly by double-clicking the box
under the To column and typing in the node name.

Follow this by double-clicking on the box to the right of this new $x1$ entry, in the column
labeled Assignment Name. Now, the drop-down menu in Figure~\ref{fig:26} appears. Scroll down and select 
{\sf Location (Accepts wildcards/groups)}. Instead of scrolling down the menu to find the desired item, 
you can just type the first letter of the item in the Assignment Name box. In this case the desired
item happens to be the first item beginning with L. Finally, double-click the box in the column labeled Value.
Type the pin assignment corresponding to $SW_0$ for your DE-series board, as listed in Table \ref{tab:pinassign}.

Use the same procedure to assign input $x2$ and output $f$ to the appropriate pins listed in
Table \ref{tab:pinassign}. An example using a DE1-SoC board is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:27}.
To save the assignments made, choose {\sf File $>$ Save}. You can also simply close 
the Assignment Editor window, in which case a pop-up box will ask if you want to save
the changes to assignments; click {\sf Yes}.
Recompile the circuit, so that it will be compiled with the correct pin assignments.

\begin{figure}[H]

      \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figures/figure25.png}
   \caption{The Node Finder displays the input and output names.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

   \caption{The available assignment names for a DE-series board.}

   \caption{The complete assignment.} 
	 \label{fig:27}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

The DE-series board has fixed pin assignments. Having finished one design, the user will want
to use the same pin assignment for subsequent designs. Going through the procedure 
described above becomes tedious if there are many pins used in the design.
A useful Quartus Prime feature allows the user to both
export and import the pin assignments from a special file format, 
rather than creating them manually
using the Assignment Editor. A simple file format that can be used for this purpose
is the {\it Quartus Settings File (QSF)} format. The format for the file for our simple project (on a DE1-SoC board) is

\begin{center} %%%\begin{singlespace}
\parbox{12.5cm}{
\begin{tabbing}
ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\kill
set$\_$location$\_$assignment PIN$\_$AB12 -to x1 \\
set$\_$location$\_$assignment PIN$\_$AC12 -to x2 \\
set$\_$location$\_$assignment PIN$\_$V16 -to f \\

\end{tabbing} } %%%\end{singlespace}
\end{center}

\noindent
By adding lines to the file, any number of pin assignments can be created.
Such {\it qsf} files can be imported into any design project.

If you created a pin assignment for a particular project, you can export it
for use in a different project. To see how this is done, open again the Assignment Editor
to reach the window in Figure~\ref{fig:27}. Select {\sf Assignments $>$ Export Assignment} which leads to the
window in Figure~\ref{fig:28}. Here, the file {\it light.qsf} is available for export.
Click on {\sf OK}.
If you now look in the directory, you will see that
the file {\it light.qsf} has been created.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/figure28.png}
   \caption{Exporting the pin assignment.} 
	 \label{fig:28}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

You can import a pin assignment by choosing {\sf Assignments $>$ Import Assignments}. 
This opens the dialogue in Figure~\ref{fig:29} to select the file to import. 
Type the name of the file, including the {\it qsf} extension and the full path
to the directory that holds the file, in the File Name box and press {\sf OK}.
Of course, you can also browse to find the desired file.
 
\begin{figure}[H]
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/figure29.png}
   \caption{Importing the pin assignment.} 
	 \label{fig:29}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

For convenience when using large designs, all relevant pin assignments for the 
DE-series board are given in individual files. For example, the DE1-SoC pin assignments 
can be found in the {\it DE1\_SoC.qsf} file, which is available from Intel's FPGA University
Program website.
This file uses the names found in the {\it DE1-SoC User Manual}.
If we wanted to make the pin assignments for our example circuit by importing
this file, then we would have to use the same names in our 
Block Diagram/Schematic design file;
namely, {\it SW[0]}, {\it SW[1]} and {\it LEDG[0]} for 
{\it x1}, {\it x2} and {\it f}, respectively.
Since these signals are specified in the {\it DE1\_SoC.qsf} file
as elements of vectors {\it SW} and {\it LEDG}, we must refer to them in the same
way in our design file. For example, in the {\it DE1\_SoC.qsf} 
file the 10 toggle switches are called {\it SW[9]} to {\it SW[0]}.
In a design file they can also be referred to as a vector {\it SW[9..0]}.
