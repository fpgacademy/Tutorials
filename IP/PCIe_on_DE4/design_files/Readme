Notes:
1. Might need to change the file format from Windows to UNIX first,
so go to the demo and driver folders before running any programs, run:
	dos2unix *

2. To reprogram the FPGA without needing to restart the host computer if a valid PCIe connection has already been made,
go to the demo folder, run: 
	./reprogram save
	<program a new sof>
	./repgrogram restore
Then go back to the driver folder to unload the driver first using:
	./unload_alt_up_pci_driver.sh
And reload it using:
	./load_alt_up_pci_driver.sh
The device connection should be reestablished.
